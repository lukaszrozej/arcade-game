Arcade Game
===============================

A project for Udacity [Front-End Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

## How to play

You can play the game [here](https://lukaszrozej.github.io/arcade-game/)

Use arrow keys to move. Get to the river at the top of the screen. Avoid contact with the bugs.

## How to run

Clone my repository by running:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:lukaszrozej/arcade-game.git
```

Then open index.html in your browser

## Resources used

I used [Planet Cute image set](http://www.lostgarden.com/2007/05/dancs-miraculously-flexible-game.html) for most graphics.
(The images provided by Udacity where a part of this set.)

The explosion sprites are from  [Open Game Art](https://opengameart.org/content/explosions-0)
and splash sprites from [Manhattan Dave](https://daveriskit.wordpress.com/2015/01/17/sprite-maker/).

The images where edited using [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/) and [PIXLR EDITOR](https://pixlr.com/editor/).

The sprite class was inspired by [an article by James Long](https://jlongster.com/Making-Sprite-based-Games-with-Canvas).
