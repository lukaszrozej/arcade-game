Arcade Game
===============================

A project for Udacity [Front-End Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

## How to play

You can play the game [here](https://lukaszrozej.github.io/arcade-game/)

Get to the wooden spot at the top of the screen.
Avoid contact with land bugs and doppelganger.
Avoid falling into water.
You can jump on water bugs.
You can push the rocks around.
You can collect: keys to open a door, orange gems for points and green gems for lives.

You can't move if you have the following obstacles in your way:
a tree, two rocks in a row, a rock and a collectible item in row.

Use arrow keys to move.
Your doppelganger reacts to arrow keys with up and down switched.


If you get stuck in level press R to restart it.

Clone my repository by running:

## Resources used

I used [Planet Cute image set](http://www.lostgarden.com/2007/05/dancs-miraculously-flexible-game.html) for most graphics.
(The images provided by Udacity where a part of this set.)

The explosion sprites are from  [Open Game Art](https://opengameart.org/content/explosions-0)
and splash sprites from [Manhattan Dave](https://daveriskit.wordpress.com/2015/01/17/sprite-maker/).

The images where edited using [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/) and [PIXLR EDITOR](https://pixlr.com/editor/).

The sprite class was inspired by [an article by James Long](https://jlongster.com/Making-Sprite-based-Games-with-Canvas).
